# OpenCV-_Tutorial

This tutorial focuses on some basic operations in OpenCV that one can implement for image transformations.

It also includes a short application for finding the number of objects in an image. Please note that the image selected has a white background here and the method is not advanced. 
It only involves concepts of edge detection, thresholding and contouring.
